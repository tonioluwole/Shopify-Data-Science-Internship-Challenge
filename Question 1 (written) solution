1a. A possible flaw with this calculation is that the literal average value of the orders has a few, 
impactful outliers. The customer with the user id of 607 is especially skewing the data quite a bit 
because they’re spending a lot more money than the other users and a lot more frequently, not to 
mention the other users that spend tens of thousands so it makes the average price unnaturally high. 
So those orders should not really be taken into consideration when trying to find a realistic average order amount.

1b. Since the mean is out of the picture, Instead, we should use one of the other measures of central tendency - 
median or mode. Since the data can be mathematically ordered, and it’s skewed, A median is our best bet!

1c. The value is 284, found using =MEDIAN(D:D) on excel/sheets. To be honest I got stuck trying to load the sorted orderAmount
values into a new array in my Java Program attempting to solve this problem. Hopefully being at an internship like this 
can teach me how to not get stuck like this anymore
